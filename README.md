# NGA-LTER-gliders
This repo holds all the code that was used to process gliders deployed in the northern gulf of alaska during the timespan of 2021 to 2024. This code is what PhD candidate Isaac Reister used to standardize variable names, identify upcasts and downcasts, and split upcasts and downcasts up, then complete various quality control measures. (note the actual splitting and quality control code are not ready for uploading, has too many wandering trains of thought, but it will be here eventually). 

Sequence is:
1) Data ProcessingGlider_AllGliderVariablesMaker2
2) Data ProcessingGlider_Profilesplitterv4
3) DataProcessingGlider_QCglider_and_verticalgridding
